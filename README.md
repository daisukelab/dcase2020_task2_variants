# DCASE2020 Challenge Task 2 baseline variants
This is a repository to share variants of baseline system for **DCASE 2020 Challenge Task 2 "Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sounds for Machine Condition Monitoring"**. 

http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-unsupervised-detection-of-anomalous-sounds

## Description

Baseline system implements Autoencoder with Keras, and reproducible training & testing codes are provided.

This repository expands the baseline by:

- Making it easier to duplicate solution, and try your own ideas on it with less effort.
- Providing PyTorch version of the baseline.
- TBD --> Hoping to have time to show some of my ideas.
